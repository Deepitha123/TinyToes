### **Establish a Bedtime Routine**
Keep a consistent bedtime schedule.
Create a calming routine with activities like bathing, gentle rocking, or lullabies.
### **Create a Comfortable Sleep Environment**
Keep the room dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature (around 68–72°F or 20–22°C).
Use a firm mattress with a fitted sheet and no pillows, blankets, or stuffed toys to reduce SIDS risk.
### **Follow Safe Sleep Practices**
Always place the baby on their back to sleep.
Avoid soft bedding, crib bumpers, and loose blankets.
Use a sleep sack instead of blankets for warmth.
### **Understand Baby’s Sleep Cycles**
Newborns sleep 14-17 hours a day but in short periods of 2-4 hours.
Their sleep patterns are irregular, but they gradually develop a routine.`;
